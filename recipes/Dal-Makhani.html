    <img src="images/Dal-Makhani.jpg" alt="Dal Makhani Image" height="500" width="600">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is a popular North Indian or Punjabi cuisine lentil curry made with a combination of black lentils aka urad dal and kidney beans aka rajma. Dal Makhani is known for its rich and creamy texture and taste and is often served with flavored rice like jeera rice or basic pulao rice recipes. The creamy texture of the dal is due to the way the lentils are cooked. It is slow-cooked for hours in low flame and the lentils with beans turn out to be creamy and rich in texture.

        There are myriad ways to make this traditional Dal Makhni curry, but the traditional recipe is made with just urad dal and rajma beans. Initially, it is soaked and pressure cooked and then simmered and slow-cooked for hours and sometimes overnight. The curry is basically cooked and tossed with tomato and onion base which makes it sharp and tangy in taste. It is further added with full cream as an additional or optional topping which makes it even more creamy and tasty.</p>
