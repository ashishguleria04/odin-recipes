    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gajar ka Halwa, also called Gajrela, is an Indian carrot pudding that is rich, creamy, and delicious. It is made with cooking carrots with milk, sugar, and ghee. I also like to add some ground cardamom, which adds a wonderful aroma and flavor to the pudding.</p>
    <p>Gajar ka Halwa can be enjoyed as is, or served warm with a scoop of ice cream topped with slivered pistachios. It is heavenly!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Carrots: Use fresh carrots, red or orange, whichever is available.</li>
        <li>Dairy Products: milk - for creamy texture, Ghee/Clarified Butter</li>
        <li>Sugar: as a sweetener for this recipe, you can use dates and jaggery too.</li>
        <li>Cardamom: for perfect aroma and flavour.</li>
        <li>Nuts: any nuts of your choice - cashews, almonds, pistachious, and even raisins.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with washing the carrots. Then, peel them using a peeler.</li>
        <li>Then we have to grate the carrots. You can use a hand grater or a good processor. The main thing to note is to use the thicker grate.</li>
        <li>Add the grated carrots to a large pan and turn the heat to medium-high. Saute the carrots for 5 minutes so that some of the moisture is removed. </li>
        <li>Now add the milk to the same pan and let the milk (with the carrots) come to a boil. Then, lower the heat to medium flame and let it cook.</li>
        <li>Cook the carrots until all the liquid is evaporated. Stir frequently, as you donâ€™t want the halwa to scorch the bottom of the pan. This will take about 35-45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now add the sugar to the halwa. The sugar will release water and make the halwa a little liquidy. Cook until the halwa becomes dry again. </li>
        <li>Now add the cardamom powder, and remaining ghee and mix will the carrot halwa. This gives a great final touch and taste of ghee to the Halwa. Roast for a couple of minutes for the ghee to mix into the halwa.</li>
        <li>Now add nuts of your choice and mix them well. </li>


    </ol>
